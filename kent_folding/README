The kent folding extensions for vim by Mario Schweigler are 
available from 
  https://www.informatico.de/kent-vim-ext/ .

The older version did not support the go language, so you may need to
apply the patch in this directory. The patch adds support for several
extra languages including go.

If you do not already have ~/.vim and ~/.gvimrc subdirectories you
can cd $HOME and unpack kent-vim-ext-rc-unix.tar.gz there:

$ tar -xzf kent-vim-ext-rc-unix.tar.gz

Then enter the ~/.vim directory and unpack kent-vim-ext-runtime.tar.xz:

$ tar -xzf kent-vim-ext-runtime.tar.gz

One of the files which is unpacked is kent-programming.vim. 

The old version has a sha1 checksum of
   d2efff1787039e3fbada1309d1b60cc797105558 :
$ sha1sum kent-programming.vim 
d2efff1787039e3fbada1309d1b60cc797105558  kent-programming.vim

If you have that version you need to apply the patch:

$ patch -p1 <kent-programming.vim.patch 

When you use vim, documentation is available via :help kent-*

A screenshot of part of the folded source is included in this directory:
folding.png. This should give an idea of how the folded sources should
look in vim.
